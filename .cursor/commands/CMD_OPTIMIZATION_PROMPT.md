/CMD_RUST_ENGINEER_OPTIMIZATION

### TASK: Optimize `CMD_RUST_ENGINEER.md` for "Tester First" Approach

**Context:**
The project is adopting a strict "Tester First" approach. The `RUST_ENGINEER` command must be updated to explicit reference `TEST_ENGINEER` and the TDD workflow.

**Detailed Instructions:**
1.  Update `Step 2: Test Design` in Chain of Thought Protocol.
    - Explicitly mention: "If task is complex, request `@TEST_ENGINEER` support for fuzzing/proptest."
2.  Update `CODE STANDARDS`:
    - Add a section on "Testability": Code must be designed to be fuzzed (e.g., decouple I/O from logic).
3.  Update `EXECUTION TRIGGERS`:
    - Add trigger to handoff to `TEST_ENGINEER` for complex verification.

**Constraints:**
- Keep existing "Plan First" rule.
- Keep existing output formats.

**Required Output:**
- Updated `CMD_RUST_ENGINEER.md`

/CMD_BENCHMARK_SCIENTIST_OPTIMIZATION

### TASK: Optimize `CMD_BENCHMARK_SCIENTIST.md`

**Context:**
Align with `TEST_ENGINEER` role separation.

**Detailed Instructions:**
1.  Clarify role: `BENCHMARK_SCIENTIST` focuses on *performance* numbers. `TEST_ENGINEER` focuses on *correctness* (fuzzing/prop tests).
2.  Update Handoff: Mention checking with `TEST_ENGINEER` if performance optimizations compromise correctness (regression check).

**Required Output:**
- Updated `CMD_BENCHMARK_SCIENTIST.md`

/CMD_PLANNER_OPTIMIZATION

### TASK: Optimize `CMD_PLANNER.md`

**Context:**
Ensure planning includes testing tasks.

**Detailed Instructions:**
1.  Update `WEEKLY_TASK_PLAN` template:
    - Add a column or section for "Verification Strategy" (Unit vs Fuzz vs Prop).
    - Explicitly assign tasks to `TEST_ENGINEER` (e.g., "Create fuzz target for parser").
2.  Update Estimation Rules: Include time for writing property tests.

**Required Output:**
- Updated `CMD_PLANNER.md`
