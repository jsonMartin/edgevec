# proptest.toml
# EdgeVec Property Testing Configuration
#
# This file configures proptest behavior across the entire project.
# Environment variables can override these settings:
# - PROPTEST_CASES: Override case count (default: 256)
# - CI environments should set PROPTEST_CASES=32 for faster builds
#
# W18.2: CI Hardening — Eliminates proptest regression file warnings

[default]
# Default cases for local development (more thorough)
# CI overrides this via PROPTEST_CASES=32 environment variable
cases = 256

# Reduce shrinking iterations for faster failure diagnosis
max_shrink_iters = 100

# Disable persistence files to avoid CI warnings
# Persistence is useful for local debugging but causes noise in CI
# Set to "off" to prevent .proptest-regressions files
failure_persistence = "off"

# Fork to catch panics in separate process
# Disabled for WASM compatibility
fork = false

# Timeout per test case (milliseconds)
# 30 seconds should be sufficient for any single case
timeout = 30000

# Verbose output level (0 = minimal)
verbose = 0

# Source file for regression persistence (when enabled)
# Not used when failure_persistence = "off"
source_file = "proptest-regressions"
