## Original Findings vs. Remediation

### Critical Issues (BLOCKING) — ALL RESOLVED

#### [C1] Pre-Release Validation Failed
**Original Finding:** Missing snippets directory was not caught before npm publish.

**Remediation Verified:** COMPLETE
- Created comprehensive 44-item `.claude/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
- Includes explicit package content verification
- Includes npm dry-run validation
- Includes post-publish smoke test

#### [C2] Insufficient Hotfix Documentation
**Original Finding:** No post-mortem explaining root cause, timeline, or prevention.

**Remediation Verified:** COMPLETE
- Created `docs/incidents/2025-12-12_alpha1_missing_snippets.md`
- Complete timeline (detection to resolution in ~10 minutes)
- Root cause analysis (snippets/ not in package.json files array)
- Impact assessment and prevention measures

#### [C3] No Post-Mortem Document
**Original Finding:** Same as C2.

**Remediation Verified:** COMPLETE (same artifact as C2)

### Major Issues (MUST FIX) — ALL RESOLVED

#### [M1] CHANGELOG Lacks Severity Warnings
**Original Finding:** CHANGELOG didn't clearly mark 0.2.0-alpha.1 as broken.

**Remediation Verified:** COMPLETE
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with explicit `HOTFIX` labels
- Added `DEPRECATED (DO NOT USE)` warning for 0.2.0-alpha.1
- Included incident reference links

#### [M2] npm Deprecation Not Verified
**Original Finding:** No evidence that 0.2.0-alpha.1 was actually deprecated.

**Remediation Verified:** COMPLETE

## Lessons Learned

1. **Pre-release validation is critical** — Missing snippets/ was caught too late
2. **Fast incident response works** — 10-minute fix time prevented major user impact
3. **Documentation prevents recurrence** — Checklist now prevents similar issues
4. **HOSTILE_REVIEWER gate is effective** — Initial rejection forced rigorous remediation
