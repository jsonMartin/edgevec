## Summary

The Week 7 Gate Check Final Doc Sync has been executed. The previous major issue [M1] regarding the omission of **Scalar Quantization (SQ8)** from public documentation has been addressed.

Both `README.md` and `src/lib.rs` now explicitly list Scalar Quantization as a completed, working feature, reflecting the actual state of the codebase (Week 6 implementation).

The documentation now accurately represents the system's capabilities, including the 4x memory reduction feature.
