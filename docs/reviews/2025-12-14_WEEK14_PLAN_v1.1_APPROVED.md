# HOSTILE_REVIEWER: Week 14 Plan APPROVED

**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Artifact:** `docs/planning/weeks/week_14/WEEKLY_TASK_PLAN.md` (v1.1)
**Author:** PLANNER
**Verdict:** APPROVED

---

## Executive Summary

The revised Week 14 plan successfully addresses all critical and major issues from the previous rejection. The plan now:

1. **Correctly scopes W14.1** — Acknowledges existing WASM batch implementation, focuses only on progress callback enhancement (4h instead of 12h)
2. **Achieves 30% contingency** — 28h scheduled / 40h budget = 12h buffer
3. **Uses explicit 3x rule** — All estimates show base calculation
4. **References specific files** — Line numbers provided for all existing implementations
5. **Provides detailed test procedures** — AC14.2.4 includes synthetic regression test steps

## Previous Rejection Resolution

| Issue | Status |
|:------|:-------|
| **[C1]** W14.1 scope false premise | ✅ RESOLVED — Reduced to 4h, acknowledged existing implementation |
| **[M1]** Vague dependencies | ✅ RESOLVED — Added specific file references |
| **[M2]** 5% buffer only | ✅ RESOLVED — Now 30% (12h buffer) |
| **[M3]** 3x rule not stated | ✅ RESOLVED — Line 43 explicit statement |
| **[M4]** baselines.json exists | ✅ RESOLVED — AC14.2.2 says "verified/updated" |
| **[m1]** Vague synthetic regression | ✅ RESOLVED — Full test procedure in AC14.2.4 |
| **[m2]** Pre-flight inaccuracy | ✅ RESOLVED — Checklist corrected |

## Verification Performed

```bash
# Tests pass (125)
cargo test --lib
# Result: ok. 125 passed

# Clippy clean
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
# Result: No warnings

# Existing implementation verified
grep "insert_batch_flat\|insertBatch" src/wasm/mod.rs
# Lines 258, 261, 341 confirmed

# Baselines file exists
cat benches/baselines.json
# Created 2025-12-13, version 1.0.0
```

## Approval Authorization

**HOSTILE_REVIEWER** has verified:

- [x] All critical issues from previous rejection resolved
- [x] All major issues from previous rejection resolved
- [x] 3x estimation rule explicitly applied
- [x] 30% contingency buffer achieved
- [x] Existing implementations acknowledged with specific locations
- [x] Dependencies are specific and verifiable
- [x] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [x] Risks are identified with mitigations
- [x] Aligns with Phase 4 (Integration) objectives
- [x] No new unsafe code planned

---

## UNLOCK

**Week 14 implementation may proceed.**

Implementation agents are authorized to execute:
- `/rust-implement W14.1` (WASM_SPECIALIST)
- `/bench-baseline W14.2` (BENCHMARK_SCIENTIST)
- `/doc-readme W14.4` (DOCWRITER)

---

## Gate Status

This approval does NOT create a new gate file. Week 14 is an incremental plan within the already-unlocked Phase 4 (Integration).

Existing gates:
- `GATE_2_COMPLETE.md` — Planning → Implementation (active)
- `GATE_10_COMPLETE.md` — Week 10 completion (active)

**Verdict:** APPROVED
