## Verdict

**APPROVED**

This artifact meets all quality gates and may proceed to the next phase.

The plan now correctly mandates that the "Boss Fight" (Day 9) stress-tests the storage engine against real-world crash scenarios (truncated/torn writes), ensuring durability claims are verified by `proptest`.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to Week 2 Implementation (starting Day 6).
