- ✅ GitHub release live
- ✅ npm package live
- ✅ Social media announcements posted

**Dependencies:**
- W9D43 complete
- **[USER]** Access to GitHub issues
- **[USER]** Access to npm download stats

## 2. Technical Plan

### Part 0: Critical Bug Response Protocol Setup (W9.6.0 — 30min) **[PRODUCTION-CRITICAL]**

**Owner:** ALL
**Type:** AGENT_ACTION + USER_ACTION

**Rationale:** First bug reported sets the tone. Have protocol ready BEFORE first issue arrives.

#### 2.0.1 Configure GitHub Notifications (15min)

**[USER_ACTION REQUIRED]**

```
Configure immediate notifications for new GitHub issues:

1. Install GitHub mobile app (if not already):
   - iOS: https://apps.apple.com/app/github/id1477376905
   - Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android

2. Enable push notifications for edgevec repository:
   - Open GitHub app
   - Navigate to edgevec repository
   - Settings → Notifications
   - Enable: "Issues" → "New issues"
   - Enable: "Participating, @mentions, and custom"

3. Verify notification test:
   - Create test issue in repo
   - Check mobile notification arrives within 1 minute
   - Delete test issue

4. Set notification quiet hours (optional but recommended):
   - 11pm-7am local time (get sleep during alpha)
```

**Acceptance:** Mobile notification received within 1 min of test issue creation.

#### 2.0.2 Create Response Templates (15min)

### Part 1: Monitoring Infrastructure Setup (W9.6 — 1h)

**Owner:** DOCWRITER
**Type:** AGENT_ACTION

#### 2.1.1 Create Issue Triage Template (30min)

**AGENT_ACTION:**

Create `docs/release/v0.2.0-alpha.1/ISSUE_TRIAGE.md`:

```markdown
# EdgeVec v0.2.0-alpha.1 Issue Triage Log

**Release Date:** 2025-12-14
**Monitoring Period:** 2025-12-16 to 2025-12-19

---

## Triage Priority Definitions

| Priority | Label | Response SLA | Action |
|:---------|:------|:-------------|:-------|
| **P0** | `critical` | 4 hours | Hotfix release required |
| **P1** | `bug` | 24 hours | Investigate and fix |
| **P2** | `question` | 48 hours | Answer or update docs |

## Escalation Thresholds

### P0 Criteria (Critical — 4h response)

Issue is P0 if ANY of these are true:
- [ ] Package fails to install (`npm install` error)
- [ ] Package fails to import (runtime error on require/import)
- [ ] Search returns incorrect results (wrong neighbors)
- [ ] Data corruption (IndexedDB persistence broken)
- [ ] Security vulnerability discovered
- [ ] Memory leak causing browser crash
- [ ] WASM binary fails to load in any major browser

**Action:** Immediate hotfix. Consider unpublish if within 72h.

### P0 Coverage Model

**On-Call Availability:** Business hours only (alpha release)

**Business Hours Definition:**
- Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm local time
- P0 issues outside business hours addressed next business day by 9am

**Rationale:** This is an alpha release with limited adoption expected. 24/7 coverage not justified until beta/stable release.

### P1 Criteria (Bug — 24h response)

Issue is P1 if ANY of these are true:
- [ ] Performance >2x slower than documented benchmarks
- [ ] Specific browser/platform compatibility issue
- [ ] Edge case causing incorrect results (non-reproducible in general)
- [ ] Documentation mismatch with actual behavior
- [ ] TypeScript types incorrect or missing

**Action:** Investigate within 24h. Fix in v0.2.0-alpha.2 if severe.

### P2 Criteria (Question — 48h response)

- [ ] "How do I...?" usage questions
- [ ] Feature clarification requests
- [ ] Documentation improvement suggestions
- [ ] Non-blocking edge cases

**Action:** Answer or add to FAQ. May update docs.

### P3 Criteria (Enhancement — Backlog)

- [ ] Feature requests
- [ ] Performance optimization ideas
- [ ] API suggestions
- [ ] Integration requests

**Action:** Thank user, add to v0.3.0 backlog. Close with explanation.

### Failure Modes

| Failure | Recovery Action |
|:--------|:----------------|
| P0 issue found | Execute hotfix workflow immediately |
| High volume of issues | Prioritize by severity; focus on P0/P1 |
| Unclear issue reports | Request reproduction steps |
| Social media backlash | Respond professionally; address concerns |

---

## 5. Deliverables

| Artifact | Location | Owner | Status |
|:---------|:---------|:------|:-------|
| Issue triage template | `docs/release/v0.2.0-alpha.1/ISSUE_TRIAGE.md` | DOCWRITER | [ ] |

---

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|:-----|:------------|:-------|:-----------|
| Critical bug found | Low | CRITICAL | Hotfix workflow ready; 4h SLA |
| High issue volume | Medium | Medium | Triage by priority; focus on P0/P1 |
| Negative feedback | Low | Medium | Respond professionally; learn from it |
| No feedback at all | Medium | Low | Normal for alpha; continue marketing |
| User confusion | Medium | Low | Improve docs; create FAQ |

---

## 7. Next Step

After W9D44 completion (end of Day 2):

```bash
# Update issue triage with Day 2 summary
echo "Day 1-2 Monitoring Complete"

# Check for unresolved P0/P1
# If P0 exists: DO NOT proceed to Day 45 until resolved

# Record metrics
echo "Stars: [N], Forks: [N], Downloads: [N], Issues: [N]"

# Proceed to Day 45
# Reference: docs/planning/weeks/week9/W9D45.md
```

**Pipeline:**
W9D41 (Validation + GitHub) → W9D42 (Tag + Publish) → W9D43 (Announce) → **W9D44** (Monitor 1-2) → W9D45 (Monitor 3-5)

---

**Ready for Execution:** Monitoring is primarily USER_ACTION. Check GitHub issues and npm stats every 4 hours during waking hours. Respond to P0 immediately.

---

**END OF W9D44**
