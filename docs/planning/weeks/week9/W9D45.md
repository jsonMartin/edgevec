# W9D45 — Monitoring Day 3-5 & Week 9 Close

**Date:** 2025-12-18 to 2025-12-19
**Phase:** Week 9 - Alpha Release (Day 5 of 5)
**Owner:** ALL (RUST_ENGINEER, WASM_SPECIALIST, DOCWRITER, PLANNER)
**Tasks:** W9.6 (Part 2), Week 9 Retrospective
**Estimated Hours:** 6h (of 12h total for W9.6)

---

## 1. Context

Day 45 concludes Week 9 and the alpha release monitoring period. By this point:
- Critical bugs (P0) should be resolved or under active investigation
- Initial community feedback collected
- Download/engagement metrics recorded

This day focuses on:
- Continued monitoring (reduced frequency)
- Collecting lessons learned
- Planning Week 10 and v0.3.0

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ W9D44 complete (Day 1-2 monitoring done)
- ✅ No unresolved P0 issues (or hotfix in progress)
- ✅ ISSUE_TRIAGE.md updated with Day 1-2 data

**Dependencies:**
- W9D44 complete
- No critical blockers

---

## 2. Technical Plan

### Part 1: Continued Monitoring (W9.6 — 3h)

**Owner:** ALL
**Type:** USER_ACTION

#### 2.1.1 Day 3-5 Monitoring Schedule

**[USER_ACTION REQUIRED]**

```markdown
## Reduced Monitoring Schedule (Day 3-5)

### Daily (Once Per Day)

- [ ] Check GitHub Issues for new P0/P1
- [ ] Check npm download stats
- [ ] Respond to any unanswered questions
- [ ] Update ISSUE_TRIAGE.md metrics

### End of Day 5 (Final Check)

- [ ] Review all open issues
- [ ] Label remaining issues for v0.3.0
- [ ] Compile final metrics
- [ ] Prepare week summary
```

#### 2.1.2 Issue Backlog Processing

**[USER_ACTION REQUIRED]**

```
For all issues NOT resolved during Day 1-2:

1. P1 (Bug) issues:
   - If reproducible: Add to v0.3.0 milestone
   - If not reproducible: Request more info, label 'needs-reproduction'

2. P2 (Question) issues:
   - Answer if possible
   - If common question: Add to FAQ (create if needed)

3. P3 (Enhancement) issues:
   - Label 'enhancement'
   - Add to v0.3.0 planning backlog
   - Close with comment: "Thanks! Added to backlog for v0.3.0 consideration."
```

#### 2.1.3 FAQ Creation (If Needed)

**AGENT_ACTION (if 3+ similar questions):**

Create `docs/FAQ.md`:

```markdown
# EdgeVec FAQ

## Installation

### Q: How do I install EdgeVec?

```bash
npm install @edgevec/core
```

### Q: What browsers are supported?

EdgeVec supports all modern browsers with WebAssembly support:
- Chrome 57+
- Firefox 52+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 16+

### Q: Does it work with Node.js?

Yes! EdgeVec works in Node.js 16+ with full feature parity.

---

## Usage

### Q: What embedding dimensions are supported?

EdgeVec supports any dimension from 1 to 4096. Common dimensions:
- 384 (MiniLM)
- 768 (BERT, all-mpnet-base-v2)
- 1536 (OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002)
- 3072 (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large)

### Q: How do I persist data?

```javascript
// Save to IndexedDB
await client.save('my-index');

// Load later
const client = await EdgeVecClient.load('my-index', { dimensions: 768 });
```

---

## Performance

### Q: Why is my search slow?

Check:
1. Are you using Quantized mode? (3x faster than Float32)
2. Is ef_search set appropriately? (higher = slower but more accurate)
3. Are you running in development mode? (release builds are faster)

### Q: How much memory does it use?

| Mode | Per Vector (768d) |
|:-----|:------------------|
| Float32 | ~3,176 bytes |
| Quantized (SQ8) | ~872 bytes |

For 100k vectors: ~83 MB (Quantized) or ~303 MB (Float32)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Import fails with "WebAssembly.instantiate" error

This usually means WASM isn't supported or is blocked. Check:
1. Browser supports WebAssembly
2. No Content-Security-Policy blocking WASM
3. Running on HTTPS (required for some browsers)

### Q: "Out of memory" error

EdgeVec uses WebAssembly linear memory which can grow but not shrink.
For large datasets (>500k vectors), consider:
1. Using Quantized mode (3.6x less memory)
2. Periodic index reload to defragment
