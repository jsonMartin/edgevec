## 2. Technical Plan

### Part 1: Prepare Announcement Content (W9.5 — 1.5h)

**Owner:** DOCWRITER
**Type:** AGENT_ACTION

#### 2.1.1 GitHub Announcement (15min)

The GitHub release created in W9D42 serves as the official announcement. Verify it's complete.

**AGENT_ACTION:**

```bash
# Verify GitHub release is published (not draft)

```

#### 2.1.2 Twitter/X Announcement (15min)

**AGENT_ACTION:** Prepare tweet content (USER will post)

```markdown

#### 2.1.3 Reddit r/rust Announcement (30min)

**AGENT_ACTION:** Prepare Reddit post (USER will post)

**Title:** `[ANN] EdgeVec v0.2.0-alpha.1 - High-performance vector search for Browser/Node/Edge (Rust + WASM)`

**Body:**

```markdown
Hi r/rust!

I'm excited to share **EdgeVec**, a high-performance vector database written in Rust with first-class WASM support.

## What is it?

EdgeVec implements HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs for approximate nearest neighbor search. It's designed to run entirely in the browser, Node.js, or edge devices — no server required.

## Performance

| Scale | Float32 | Quantized (SQ8) |
|:------|:--------|:----------------|
| 10k vectors | 203 µs | **88 µs** |
| 50k vectors | 480 µs | **167 µs** |
| 100k vectors | 572 µs | **329 µs** |

Tested on 768-dimensional vectors (typical embedding size), k=10 nearest neighbors.

## Key Features

- **Sub-millisecond search** at 100k scale
- **3.6x memory reduction** with Scalar Quantization (SQ8)
- **148 KB bundle** (70% under budget)
- **IndexedDB persistence** for browser storage
- **Zero network latency** — runs locally

## Quick Start

```javascript
import { EdgeVecClient } from '@edgevec/core';

const client = await EdgeVecClient.create({ dimensions: 768 });
client.insert(new Float32Array(768).fill(0.1));
const results = client.search(query, 10);
```

## Links

- GitHub: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/edgevec
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@edgevec/core
- Docs: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/edgevec/blob/main/README.md

## Known Limitations (Alpha)

- Build time not optimized (batch API planned for v0.3.0)
- No delete/update operations yet
- Single-threaded WASM execution

## Technical Details

- Pure Rust implementation
- WASM via wasm-pack/wasm-bindgen
- SIMD-optimized distance calculations (AVX2 on native, simd128 on WASM where available)
- TypeScript wrapper with Promise-based API

Looking forward to feedback! This is an alpha release, so please report any issues on GitHub.
```

#### 2.1.4 Reddit r/javascript Announcement (15min)

**AGENT_ACTION:** Prepare Reddit post (USER will post)

**Title:** `EdgeVec - Vector search that runs 100% in the browser (148KB, sub-millisecond)`

**Body:**

```markdown
Hi r/javascript!

Just released **EdgeVec** — a vector database that runs entirely in your browser, no server required.

## Why?

- Privacy: Your embeddings never leave the device
- Latency: Zero network round-trip
- Offline: Works without internet

## Performance

- **329µs** search at 100k vectors
- **148 KB** gzipped bundle
- **IndexedDB** for persistent storage

## Usage

```javascript
import { EdgeVecClient } from '@edgevec/core';

const client = await EdgeVecClient.create({ dimensions: 768 });

// Insert vectors
client.insert(new Float32Array(768).fill(0.1));

// Search
const results = client.search(queryVector, 10);
// Returns: [{ id: 0, distance: 0.0 }, ...]

// Persist to IndexedDB
await client.save('my-index');

// Load later
const loaded = await EdgeVecClient.load('my-index', { dimensions: 768 });
```

## Use Cases

- Browser extensions with semantic search
- Local-first note-taking apps
- Privacy-preserving RAG applications
- Edge computing (IoT, embedded)

## Links

- npm: `npm install @edgevec/core`
- GitHub: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/edgevec
- TypeScript types included

This is an alpha release. Feedback welcome!
```

#### 2.1.5 LinkedIn Announcement (15min)

**AGENT_ACTION:** Prepare LinkedIn post (USER will post)

```markdown
🚀 Excited to announce EdgeVec v0.2.0-alpha.1!

EdgeVec is a high-performance vector database that runs entirely in the browser, Node.js, or edge devices. Built in Rust with first-class WASM support.

Key achievements:
• Sub-millisecond search at 100k vectors
• 148 KB bundle (70% under target)
• 3.6x memory reduction with quantization
• Zero network latency — 100% local

Perfect for:
• Privacy-preserving search applications
• Browser extensions
• Offline-first apps
• Edge computing

The project started as a research experiment to see if we could achieve server-grade vector search performance in the browser. The answer: yes.

Technical stack: Rust, WebAssembly, HNSW graphs, SIMD optimizations.

Try it: npm install @edgevec/core
GitHub: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/edgevec

Looking forward to community feedback!

#### 2.1.6 Hacker News "Show HN" (optional) (15min)

**AGENT_ACTION:** Prepare HN post (USER will post at discretion)

**Title:** `Show HN: EdgeVec – Sub-millisecond vector search in the browser (Rust/WASM)`

**Text:**

```markdown
Hi HN,

I built EdgeVec, a vector database that runs entirely in the browser. It implements HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs for approximate nearest neighbor search.

Performance:
- 329µs search at 100k vectors (768 dimensions, k=10)
- 148 KB gzipped bundle

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@edgevec/core
GitHub: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/edgevec

This is an alpha release. Main limitations: build time not optimized, no delete operations yet.

Would love feedback from the community!

## 7. Next Step

After W9D43 completion:

```bash
# Mark Day 43 complete
echo "W9D43 Complete: Announcements PUBLISHED. Monitoring phase STARTING."

# Record announcement count
echo "Announcements published: [COUNT]"

# Proceed to Day 44
# Reference: docs/planning/weeks/week9/W9D44.md
```

**Pipeline:**
W9D41 (Validation + GitHub) → W9D42 (Tag + Publish) → **W9D43** (Announce) → W9D44-45 (Monitor)

---

**Ready for Execution:** Social media posting is at USER discretion. Minimum requirement: GitHub release is published (done in W9D42). All other platforms are optional but recommended for visibility.
