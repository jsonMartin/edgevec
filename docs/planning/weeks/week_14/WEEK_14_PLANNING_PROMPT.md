## PLANNED FEATURES (From CHANGELOG [Unreleased])

The following items are queued for future development:

```markdown
### Planned
- Delete/update operations with tombstone-based deletion
- P99 latency tracking in CI
- ARM/NEON optimization verification
- WASM bindings for batch insert
```

---

## ROADMAP CONTEXT

**Current Phase:** Phase 4 (Integration) — IN PROGRESS
**Next Phase:** Phase 5 (Release) — Weeks 29-32

### Phase 4 Objectives (Remaining)
From `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`:

1. **WASM Bindings:** ✅ COMPLETE (basic), ⏳ Batch insert bindings pending
2. **Browser Storage:** ✅ COMPLETE (IndexedDB)
3. **JS Client:** ✅ COMPLETE (TypeScript wrapper)
4. **Benchmarks:** ✅ COMPLETE (infrastructure)

### Phase 5 Objectives (Upcoming)
1. Finalize documentation (Rustdoc, README, Architecture)
2. Create comprehensive examples and demos
3. Final code audit and cleanup
4. Publish to crates.io and npm

---

## RECOMMENDED WEEK 14 FOCUS AREAS

Based on current status and planned features, consider these priorities:

### Priority 1: WASM Batch Insert Bindings (HIGH)
**Why:** Batch API exists in Rust (`BatchInsertable` trait) but lacks WASM bindings
**Effort:** ~16-24h
**Dependencies:** Week 12 WASM FFI work

### Priority 2: P99 Latency Tracking in CI (MEDIUM)
**Why:** Community asked for performance guarantees, CI should track regressions
**Effort:** ~12-16h
**Dependencies:** Existing benchmark infrastructure

### Priority 3: Execute Competitive Benchmarks (MEDIUM)
**Why:** Infrastructure built in W13.3a, but actual comparisons not yet run
**Effort:** ~8-12h
**Dependencies:** npm competitor libraries, WASM build

### Priority 4: ARM/NEON Optimization Verification (LOW)
**Why:** SIMD code uses AVX2, ARM untested
**Effort:** ~8h
**Dependencies:** ARM test environment

### Priority 5: Delete/Update Operations (LOWER)
**Why:** Not yet in roadmap, major feature
**Effort:** ~32-40h (multiple weeks)
**Dependencies:** Architecture decision needed

## ANTI-HALLUCINATION CLAMPS

When creating the plan:

1. **DO NOT** invent features not in CHANGELOG or ROADMAP
2. **DO NOT** assume work is complete without evidence
3. **DO NOT** create tasks > 16 hours
4. **DO NOT** ignore the 3x estimation rule
5. **DO** reference actual file paths that exist
6. **DO** use realistic hour estimates
7. **DO** ensure dependencies are resolvable within the week
8. **DO** align with Phase 4 (Integration) objectives

---

## HOSTILE_REVIEWER EXPECTATIONS

The plan will be reviewed for:

1. **Completeness:** All tasks have acceptance criteria
2. **Feasibility:** Tasks fit within 40h week budget
3. **Alignment:** Tasks match roadmap priorities
4. **Specificity:** No vague deliverables
5. **Testability:** Every feature has verification strategy
6. **Safety:** No new unsafe code without RFC

---

## EXECUTE PLANNING

**PLANNER Agent:** Create the Week 14 plan now.

1. Choose 2-4 focus areas from the recommended list
2. Decompose into tasks < 16h each
3. Create WEEKLY_TASK_PLAN.md
4. Create DAY_1_TASKS.md through DAY_5_TASKS.md
5. Submit for hostile review

**Remember:** Week 14 builds on the solid foundation of v0.2.1. Focus on completing Phase 4 (Integration) objectives before moving to Phase 5 (Release).
