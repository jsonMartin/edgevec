# W6D30: Verification & Benchmarks (Friday)

**Goal:** Prove the Pivot worked.

## Context
We need numbers. Speed vs Recall.

## Tasks

### 1. Benchmark Suite Update (W6.5)
- Update `benches/scaling.rs` to support the new `Quantized` configuration.
- Add `benches/recall.rs` to measure accuracy loss.

### 2. Run Scaling Test
- **Target:** 10k vectors (start small).
- **Expectation:**
    - Insert < 1ms.
    - Search < 1ms.
    - Memory ~25% of Week 5.

### 3. Recall Analysis
- Measure `Recall@10` for SQ8 vs f32.
- Expectation: >0.90 is good enough. >0.95 is great.

## Deliverables
- [ ] `bench_sq8_report.md`.
- [ ] Hostile Review submission.

## Verification
- **GO/NO-GO:** If we miss <1ms again, we are in deep trouble.
